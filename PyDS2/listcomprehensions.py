##### Basics of list comprehensions

# Create list comprehension: squares
squares = [i * i for i in range(10)]



# Create a 5 x 5 matrix using a list of lists: matrix
matrix = [[col for col in range(5)] for row in range(5)]

# Print the matrix
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
    
    
    

##### Using conditionals in comprehensions

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member for member in fellowship if len(member) >= 7]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)



# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member if len(member) >= 7 else "" for member in fellowship]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)



##### Using dict comprehension

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create dict comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = {member: len(member) for member in fellowship}

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)
